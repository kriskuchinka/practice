		This is based on an article I found at https://goo.gl/B4GvgF. I am following along with the tutorial to learn how to use the grid layout features in CSS.

		According to the article, this practice is only being utilized fully in IE10 and Edge, but there is a way to add flags for Chrome and Firefox. 

		Also, according to the article, this is the future of CSS alignment, given the modular elements of web driven applications.
